dragAndDrop
===========

dragAndDrop is an experiment in Git and EaselJS. Hopefully discovering the powers that
be in VCS as well as brackets. 

MASTER BRANCH
So this change is in the master branch.  It's been fun learning Git, now
time to learn how to consolidate the changes.  Thank you Aunt Polly, you are amazing.  Without you none of this would be possible.  Thank you Jesus for blessing me with an aunt who is so selfless.  I want to be generous like her, by your grace.
